# Problem Definition 
# Implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. 
# Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the 
# user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

def echo(what:str) -> None:
    print( what.lower() )

def main(): 
    echo( input("What would you like me to repeat? ") )

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
